~~ text file that would get converted to JSON ~~ 
~~ might be way to have comments this way? Plus syntax might be easier to understand? 
    however, converting from txt to JSON might just be adding extra complications that are not worth it? 
    Either way, think it might be easier to first get the JSON version working, and then can eventually switch to doing it as a txt file
        if it seems like something that would be worth doing.
