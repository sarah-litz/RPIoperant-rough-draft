this file needs to be in the run_scripts folder. the filename '__init__.py' in a folder serves as a "marker" or "flag" to let the Python compiler know that 
this folder/directory called "run_scripts" is a Python package directory. In other words, it lets the compiler know that this folder contains Python modules. 

If this file is deleted, Python will no longer look for submodules inside this directory, so attempts to import the modules in run_scripts will fail. 

So don't delete this file :)
